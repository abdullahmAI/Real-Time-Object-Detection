#Real time Object-Detection

Sink Usage Detection System:

This project is an object detection system designed to monitor the usage of sinks in a specific environment. Using computer vision techniques and a robust object detection library, the system identifies whether a sink is occupied or empty based on the presence of people using it. A real-time notification system provides status updates, making it easier to manage sink availability efficiently.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors and detects the presence of individuals using sinks.

Status Notification: Provides notifications indicating whether a sink is empty or busy.

High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced computer vision (CV) libraries to ensure precise object detection.

Customizable Deployment: Easily adaptable to various environments such as public restrooms, schools, or workspaces.


How It Works:

Video Feed Input: Captures video from a connected camera to monitor the sink area.

Object Detection: Uses a trained model to identify and track individuals near the sink.

Status Update: Determines the sink's status based on detected activity and provides real-time notifications.

Notification System: Sends status updates through a user interface or messaging system to inform about availability.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Computer Vision Library: OpenCV

Machine Learning: Pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or similar)

Hardware: Camera for video input and a computer for processing

Future Improvements:

Integration with IoT devices for automated notifications.
Support for multiple sinks in large environments.
Enhanced detection for other activities around the sink area.
